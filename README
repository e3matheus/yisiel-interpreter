Yisiel Intepreter.

The language is very similar to the GCL language [1], with some extensions
interesting for the course(Interpreter and Translator). The definition of the language its in the folder project_definition.
In the definition are left out several details in the exchange so that we(students) would find them.

The development was performed at three parts:

1. Lexicografic parsing.
2. Sintatic parsing and feeding on the Table of Symbols.
3. Construction on the abstract tree, parsing of context and interpretation.

This is one of the courses I made as student in the Simon Bolivar University, in Caracas, Venezuela.

This project was created by the Simon Bolívar University(Computer and Information Tecnology department), specifically by professor Ernesto Hernández-Novich.
